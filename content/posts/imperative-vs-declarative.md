# Imperative vs. Declarative a trade off of abstraction

Imperative is the how and delcarative is the what.

If I can trace through the execution of the program it is imperative. 

Many (if not all) declarative APIs have some sort of underlying imperative implementation *scooby do unmask meme*

Declarative can be context independent. In my own words it is a context (state) free abstraction. 

`TBD: Insert code snippets` 

# What about functional

Definition: Functional programming is a paradigm where computation is treated as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids (changing state and mutable data).  

Chain method calls: Each method in a chain returns an object, suually the original object, allowing the next method to be called on it.

Fluent interface pattern: Aims to improve the readability by chaining method calls in a way that reads like a sentance.

## What is the difference between functional and declarative?

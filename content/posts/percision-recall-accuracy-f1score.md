# Percision, Recall, and Accuracy ... why non of these click at first

## Muddy water and nuclear missles 

It was one afternoon Jaylen (one of my greatest friends) we were studying for our AI exam when the dreaded topic of percision, accuracy and recall once again came up. This is one of those concepts that I've learned before and it seems that it never wants to cement into my brain. This time around though Jaylen and I took a novel approach to building intuition through using muddy water and nuclear missles to talk build a better intuition for these (like most things in academia) dreaded and poorly named measures.

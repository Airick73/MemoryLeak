# Memory Leak

Welcome to the repository for *Memory Leak*, my personal blog. 

## About the Blog

*Memory Leak* is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and modern static site generator, and uses the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme for its sleek and responsive design. I've made some modifications to paper mod theme by overriding certain files in my `layout` folder.

### Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for viewing on any device.
- **Social Icons**: Quick links to my personal website, GitHub, and LinkedIn.
- **Comments**: Engage with the content through the integrated commenting system.
- **Navigation Enhancements**: Breadcrumbs, reading time estimates, share buttons, post navigation links, and code copy buttons enrich the user experience.

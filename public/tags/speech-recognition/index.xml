      <description>Motivation I recently completed my first semester at Georgia Tech in which I took the AI course offered by Thad Starner. Instead of moving right into another course for the summer semester I decided to use this summer to apply what I learned to a personal project.
The most interesting topic I thought we covered was the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and how they can be used for speech recognition.</description>

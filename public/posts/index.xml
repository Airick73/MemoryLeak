      <description>Why did I decide to learn about this On my journey to learn how to implement an ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) system I fell into another rabbit hole about automata. The pre-requisete of knowledge looked like this.&#xA;ASR -&amp;gt; Kaldi (ASR library) -&amp;gt; OpenFST (Finite-State Transducer library) -&amp;gt; Automata&#xA;In my experience it seems that there is a never ending linked list of things to learn before I can get to what I really want.</description>

      <description>Motivation I recently completed my first semester at Georgia Tech in which I took the AI course offered by Thad Starner. Instead of moving right into another course for the summer semester I decided to use this summer to apply what I learned to a personal project.&#xA;The most interesting topic I thought we covered was the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and how they can be used for speech recognition.</description>
